## Flutter Introduction  

/nThere are many frameworks available to develop mobile applications for Android and iOS and both.   

/n/nTo develop android applications, one can use java / kotlin language and for iOS Objective-C / Swift language can be used.    

/n/nThere are also hybrid frameworks available like React Native, Ionic, Xamarin, PhoneGap etc which support both Android and iOS OS.    

/n/nFlutter is a cross-platform UI toolkit to build applications for Android, iOS and Web with one programming language and single codebase. During development, Flutter apps run in a VM that offers stateful hot reload of changes without needing a full recompile. For release, Flutter apps are compiled directly to machine code, whether Intel x64 or ARM instructions, or to JavaScript if targeting the web. It is free and open-source. It uses Dart programming language to develop applications.
